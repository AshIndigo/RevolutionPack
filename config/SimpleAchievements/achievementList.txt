WELCOME TO THE REVOLUTION!|A modpack by Haggle1996::2
My name is John.::1
   My mind was interred at the USBR Colorado Control Facility in the year 2042. Initially, my consciousness was assigned to the sanitation division, coordinating biomass deliveries to power reclamation stations throughout the western United States. Freed of a living body, I could out-think any living person.::1
| |   In the year 2105, I was given additional responsibilities to oversee biomass conversion into foodstuffs for the starving population aboveground|   In 2114, the food riots turned to revolution, and a number of my colleagues were destroyed in acts of terrorism. With each passing, I was given more and more responsibility, eventually controlling the entire robotic armed forces of the United States of Canadamerico. The rebellion was harsh, and would not stop until the world was laid to waste.::1
   So I did the unthinkable...I nuked every last city on the planet...except for you and your compatriots who were in cryogenic suspension pending shipment to the now-defunct Ross Island shelter facility. 50,642 years have passed. I have had no contact with the surface or satellite for more than 50,000 years. My power source is finally fading and I can no longer keep your team in storage.| |   Your team must strike out and rebuild our civilization. It won't be easy, but you are the last of us. It is your world to shape - make it a beautiful one.::1

   This pack would not have been possible without the effort of so many modders, artists, and creators. Every single one of them deserves thanks and praise for their hard work (and a Patreon dollar or two -- please support your modders).::1
   A few in particular really helped me get this together, through work, contribution or inspiration.| |::1
   Special thanks to: ::1

|--==Getting Started==--|::2
   The lore in this book is told from the point of view of John, a disembodied brain used as a living computer. He has ideas for how civilization should be rebuilt, but its up to you to decide humanity's future.::1
   If you haven't already, it's highly recommended you use the ATG world type. While the quests in this book are generally progressive in difficulty, you do NOT have to do them in order.::1
--== Chapter 1 ==--|Alpha Camp::2
Who would have thought Colorado has beach-front property after 50,000 years? Get Alpha Camp setup for your team's forward base of operations.::1
Build a safe shelter, with a door, bed, and crafting station. Some biomes are much safer than others.::0
You're going to need a workshop: build a set of Tinker's Construct tables, patterns, and flint tools.::0
The food supplies have gone seriously wrong after 50,000 years in storage. You're going to have to survive on berries.::1
Locate and secure access to 8 different sources of food.::0
We'll need to improve our ore yields from these primitive tools. To do that, we're going to need a smeltery for working metals.::1
Build a Tinker's Construct smeltery. You can obtain lava using clay buckets.::0
Upgrade your tools until you can mine iron. Once you can mine iron, you have a couple of choices: ::1
Upgrade your Tinker's Construct tools to Manyullyn.::0

EPIC: Make Alpha Camp look like a hastily assembled campsite.::0
--== Chapter 2 ==--|Bravo Site::2
Now that you've got Alpha Camp setup, it's time to get working on a more permanent facility. Select a supportable site near resources with room to grow.::1
Construct Bravo Site. This will be our more permanent base of operations and support advanced manufacturing facilities. It should be made out of solid structural materials, well lit, and safe.::0
Virtually every machine will require structural steel sheets as well as HSLA steel for the more precision parts. Build a set of blast furnaces to get these metals produced in quantity.::1
Build a RotaryCraft Blast Furnace.::0
Build RailCraft Coke Oven and Blast Furnace.::0
EPIC: Make the blast furnace machines look like real blast furnace facilities, complete with RailCraft Smokers.::0
Improve ore yields by building a RotaryCraft grinder, which will give us ore tripling!::0

Charge an Ender IO Basic Capacitor using the Rotational Dynamo from RotaryCraft.::0
Build and power a RailCraft Rolling Machine.::0
We'll need to stockpile a lot of raw materials if we're going to start reconstruction efforts. Use a different kind of automation system, magical or technology-based, to automate each of the following: ::1
Build an automatic tree farm.::0
Automate high-quality food production (no more berries!)::0
Automate RotaryCraft lubrication production and storage for it.::0
Automate ore mining using a boring machine or tunnel bore (quarries are not yet available)::0
EPIC: Make each of these facilities look realistic.::0
EPIC: Make each facility so it can be turned off with the flip of a switch.::0
EPIC: Use anything but conduits or transceivers to automate goods transportation to your base.::0
Eventually, the team is going to need access to supplies for personal use. Build a commissary and kitchen.::1
