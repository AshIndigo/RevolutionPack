Hi all!

Really tiny update here (scripts and configs only -- no mod changes) to address some playability and balance issues.

### Pack Changes
- Animals will no longer spawn hostile. They will however, try to rip you to shreds in packs if you attack them.
- Additional changes to prevent souls from attacking you on teleport.
- Removed grass from from the list of blocks that zombies will dig up. This prevents the holey ground everyone is experiencing.
- Heart cannisters are more expensive
- New questers will only need to complete either the watermill OR windmill quest, whereas previously you had to complete both. If you absolutely need the fix now, do `/bg_admin default load`, but your quest progress will likely be lost.

### Bugs Squashed
- Added missing slab recipes for ore dictionary blocks. Fixes[#541](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/541)
