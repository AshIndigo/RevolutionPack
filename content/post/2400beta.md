Good evening, everyone! Welcome to another REVOLUTION|2 update!

In this update, lots of fixes to physics and many bugs squashed like the little creepy things they are! Generally, all RotaryCraft, ElectriCraft, ReactorCraft, and ChromatiCraft blocks (including pipes), are no longer subject to physics. A number of other mods were also fixed in the pass. And we tested it thoroughly this time. Yay!

Additionally, we have a new update to RTG. Again, bigger, better, more beautiful terrain. It will cause chunk borders on newly generated chunks, but is otherwise backwards compatible. No need to regenerate your worlds.

We've also added a few new minimap mods to our selection. Note that Antique Atlas must be installed on both client and server to function correctly. The other maps are okay to run client-side only. JourneyMap is still the recommended minimap mod; Map Writer works better on slower potatoes. Opis is intended only for debugging FPS problems or for server admins.

### Pack Changes
- Turned off infinite water from IE pumps
- Smelting raw ores in the blast furnace gives slag instead of cobblestone as a byproduct.
- Added recipes for flour and bonemeal to the Crusher, making 1 flour or 2 sugar per item, based on the input.
- Random Things Fertilized Dirt can now be used under AgriCraft crops (thanks to Taraxus!)
- Metal press items made by hand (instead of on the press) now yield fewer items per craft (thanks to OmegaCenti!)

### Significant Mod Updates
- Dynamic Surroundings added an in-game menu to enable/disable individual sounds without having to touch your config files. Yay!
- Updated version of Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) will produce odd chunk borders on newly generated chunks. It is safe to revert to an older version if this is extremely bothersome.

### HQM Notes
- This is a mod and bug update. Quests will be added and fixed in the next content update.

### Known Issues
- Some Forestry items (Apiarist's Chest, Stamp Collector, etc.) are uncraftable due to an interaction with DragonAPI
