Hello, everyone!

Welcome to REVOLUTION|2 Beta 2.1.3.0 -- the 'Crusher' Update!

After a solid week of playtesting, we've gotten a lot of good feedback, and this update is chock full o' quality of life updates. In particular, we've switched from a blacklist approach to physics, to a whitelist approach. What this means is fewer blocks will fall unexpectedly. We've also increased the default strength of most blocks. In exchange, we've turned on slide physics. What this means for you is that buildings you make should be even easier, and many things you place in the world no longer fall when they shouldn't. Conversely, mining and exploration has gotten a little more difficult. Found some gravel? Be careful, one small slip could fill up your cave, just like an hourglass filling the bottom with sand.

We've also dramatically streamlined and improved ore processing, adding the IE Crusher into the mix and improving your yields. You can also silk touch Harder Ores now and take them back to your lair for processing in the Crusher, at a significant advantage over a standard pick. Last, we've added a special bonus output for diamonds when you silk touch the diamond ore and drop it in the Crusher.

Lastly, we've done some tweaking, poking, pulling, and prodding to the mobs. You should have a slightly more performant group of baddies that want to eat your brain, plus a few new surprises awaiting you in the dark.  

Plus bugs. We squashed a lot of them this time around. Hope you enjoy.
