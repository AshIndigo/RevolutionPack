Hello everyone! 

Patch 2.1.0.1 is just a tiny update to fix some various bugs reported today with the pack. No big changes. Move along. There's nothing to see here.

As always, if your HQM quests are reset or otherwise altered, use /hqm edit <playername> (with cheats enabled) to fix your book.

### Bugs Squashed

- Fixed the trigger quest for HQM Chapter 2, so you no longer need to hold an iron hoe to access them.
- HarvestCraft presser has recipes again
- Forestry Ammo bags now hold ammo again
- Angel blocks now float and can be used to support other blocks, like glowstone (thanks to DaMachinator)
- All the biome-specific fog has been nerfed 70-80%.
