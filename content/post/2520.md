+++

Hello, everyone! Welcome to the next update of REVOLUTION|2, The Quest for More Money!

Sorry, needless Spaceballs reference...but moving along. Version 2.5.2.0 is another maintenance update, fixing a number of reported issues as well as rebalancing a few parts of the mod pack. In particular, Forestry is easier to start early-game, and zombie griefing power was lowered a tad. AE2 Stuff is once again working and you'll no longer have to worry about those pesky Natura trees clogging up your Woodcutter farm.

BTW, I forgot to give credit to ozBillo for the zombie texture. Check out his resource pack [Battered Old Stuff](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1229486-64x-32x-1-8-1-1-7-10-1-6-4-1-5-2-1-4-7-battered), one of my favorite resource packs!

### Pack Changes
- Open Module Turrets now use considerably less power. PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW!!!!
- Turrets (including Lumen turrets) are griefable by zombies -- if they can get close enough.
- Re-enabled Reika's null-item stack cleanup to prevent crashes. This means some items will no longer be craftable, such as the Forestry Apiarist's Chest. However, in talking to the player base experienced with bees, the overwhelming consensus is that this chest is the worst way to store your bees. If you absolutely need an apiarists chest, you can temporarily set `B:"Disallow Null-Item ItemStacks to Prevent Crashes"=false` in the config/Reika/DragonAPI.cfg file, and then set it back to true when you're done. Also note that this does not have to be set server side to function at the client.
- Cupronickel and constantan ingots are now made in the blast furnace and smelt quickly (6 seconds).
- Cupronickel and constantan ingots can now be used in place of Forestry Bronze ingots. This gates Forestry after the IE blast furnace. Addresses [#377](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/377)
- Slightly reduced the reach range of zombies when griefing blocks
- Added a few more light sources that zombies can't break.
- Fixed the in-game guide images and corrected some of the text. The guides for sluices and windmills are now useful again!
  
### Bugs Squashed
- Possibly addressed several other mod crashes by re-enabling Reika's recipe cleanup. Thanks Reika! May address [#381](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/381)
- Swapped in the correct version of AE2 Stuff, fixing the problems with placing Growth Chambers, Inscribers, etc. Fixes [#376](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/376)
- Added all missing Natural logs to the furnace. Fixes [#379](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/379)
