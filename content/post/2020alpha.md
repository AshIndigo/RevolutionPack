Hello, Everyone!

WARNING: This alpha is not 100% compatible with previous alpha builds. Expect sudden chunk borders and cut off terrain.

Welcome to what will hopefully be the very last alpha release of REVOLUTION|2. We're still waiting on a couple of mod updates to settle down before we can officially label it a 'beta' release and have stable worlds going forward. That said there's a lot of new content in this pack, including quite a list of new and exciting mods. In particular, early game changes abound, with AgriCraft replacing the standard 'break garden, receive food' method of early survival. You'll have to survive by your wits (and fruit trees and berries). Galaxy Space, Matter Overdrive, and PneumaticCraft round out the list of major mods. You'll also note Rockhounding Mod has been added, to give you a bit more variety in your worlds, as well as Better Rain (really -- it makes it better), and Ex Futurum.

There's still a few more new mods to come; though they'll all work with your beta worlds, so you won't have to restart when they show up. Stay tuned for more information. We have plenty of surprises in the works for the beta. 

### Changes:
- The first page of the HQM book is provided to help get you started in the pack; the remaining pages will be along soonâ„¢.
- You can no longer Chisel torches.
- Turned off BuildCraft Water Springs.
- Turned off Pam's garden spawns and seed drops from breaking grass. Seed are acquired through AgriCraft mutations.
- Hid many more decorative block variations (like BiblioCraft and Storage Drawers wood variations). You can still browse them in the creative tab.
- Removed Natura Cactus juice due to recipe conflict.
- Railcraft Water Tank Siding can also be crafted with wax or cactus green.
- PnuematicCraft compressed iron can be made on the alloy smelter (since it can't be made with TNT).
- Epic Bacon is no longer craftable.
