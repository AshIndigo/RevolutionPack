Hello, everyone! 

### Changes
- ReactorCraft ores (fluorite, calcite, etc) no longer spawn in the overworld, but are found in quantity on the moon and mars.  
- More entries in the noob guide, thanks to Solego. You can access the guide by opening your inventory window, then clicking on the upper book to the left of the window.
- Recurrent Complex structures, courtesy of Dorinn Bloodforge and Pterodactlol, have been added.  
- Doubled the default spawn rate of copper. It is still rare, but more common than before.
- Increased the Spice of Life food list length to 30; for the most part, this change makes early food less useful than later food (feasts). 
- Blood moon has been reduced from a 100% chance to only 5%; however, you can no longer sleep through it. Spawn rates are increased 300% but monsters despawn at morning.
- No more ridiculous villager food trades (e.g., 64 feasts for 1 emerald).
- Reduced frequency of guns and ammo in chests.
- HarvestCraft seeds can only be made through AgriCraft mutation and propagation.
- Increased mutation probabability of crops by 50%

### Bugs Squashed
- Copper ore flowers no longer spawn everywhere (only when there's copper). This was due to a Harder Ores issue.
- You should now be able to milk cows using wooden buckets.
- Skin textures glitching after death should be fixed now.
