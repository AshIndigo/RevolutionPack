Hello everyone! 

My apologies for the daily pack updates, but we're going through a period of very rapid stabilization now that the beta period has started. Keep your fingers crossed that there won't be too many more of these. :)

**Server operators** be sure to back up your /local folder and restore after the update to retain FTB Utilities settings

### Changes
- Reduced Blood Moon mob count by 33%, as many servers can't handle the huge number of mob spawns.
- More environmental sounds from Dynamic Surroundings mod

### Bugs Squashed
- Fixed the various foods in HQM chapter 2 that couldn't be detected because the food was rotten.
- Crash when clicking the server guide book to the left of the inventory window.
- Auto-backups controlled by FTB Utilities should work again.
