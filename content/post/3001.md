Hello everyone!

Quick hotfix here to address pack difficulty.

If you have not read the changelog for REVOLUTION|3 yet, take a look at it [here](http://revolutionpack.info/post/3000/).

### Pack Changes
- Creepers no longer destroy the enviroment, though some can set fire to flammable blocks
- Zombies now will only dig through unimproved materials: dirt, stone, cobblestone, grass, sand, gravel. Everything else IS SAFE.
- Removed most variations of breaching, exploding, charging mobs.
- Removed planks and glass from starting inventory, added a Potion of Regeneration
