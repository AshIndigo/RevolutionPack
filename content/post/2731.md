Hi all!

Just a tiny update here to resolve a couple of late-breaking issues with 2.7.3.0.

# Pack Changes
- Disabled the Extra Utilities Ender Collector due to a duplication bug
- Fixed a problem with the installer that would cause two versions of regular Unity to be installed, instead of Unity and Unity for RotaryCraft. If you want to use the full Unity suite, you should have Unity for RotaryCraft listed first, then Unity 1.3.1, then default Minecraft, in your resource packs list.

# Reverted Mods
- Ender IO to previous version, due to Farming Stations not functioning.
