Hello everyone!

There is absolutely nothing to see here in this update. Not a thing...except of course for DRACONIC EVOLUTION! Whee!

But HAGGLE! How could you put such OPness into REV|2? HOW COULD YOU!?!?

Simple, I say. Make it a worthy reward of being already OP. First, you're going to need some Terrasteel from Botania. Certainly not the end of the world, but it's a start. Add into that Bedrock (RotaryCraft) and Bedrockium (Extra Utilities) ingots, forged from the densest materials in the world. A slick layer of VoidMetal from the Eldritch Horrors of Thaumcraft which channels the energy of the Ender Dragon, and finally, top it all off with a Spatial IO ingot from ChromatiCraft; and what have you for all that hard work? 4 ingots of sweet, sweet Draconium. 

But HAGGLE! That's insane! Who would want to pay such a high price for these ingots!?!?!? That's like gating it behind impossible!

Or is it? I'll tell you now, there's a secret to getting lots of Draconium. Lots. Just don't tell!    

After that introduction, it's a bit hard to introduce the other big mods added this round, but they're pretty awesome in their own right. First up, we have Gwycraft, a mod from one of our own community players gwydion! Who doesn't love more decorative stones (and a use for all that dye)?

Rounding out our selection of mods is Hardcore Ender Expansion. Oddly enough, this mod fixes a bunch of problems we had with the End. I thought, 'Do I want to beg mod authors to fix bugs? Or would I rather add awesome content to explore?' Obviously, the bugs won out.

Lastly, we've added NotEnoughIDs to the pack, which addresses the problem upgrading from pre-2.7. You shouldn't have to muck about with your NBT stuff anymore.

### Pack Changes
- Draconium Ore does not spawn
- Draconium Ingots are made in the Arc Furnace using Terrasteel (Botania), Spatial Alloy Ingots (ChromatiCraft), Bedrock Ingots (RotaryCraft), Bedrockium Ingots (Extra Utilities), and VoidMetal Ingots (Thaumcraft).
- Improved the circumstances in which ChromatiCraft temples can spawn.
- Fixed some loot bags that should never have been.
- Changed the Chunk Animator animation to be more awesome in the End and Space.
- Rebalanced sleeping. Sleeping no longer resets the world clock to morning. However, we've increased the rate you regain sleep at night and reduced the rate at which you get tired. This also means caffeinated foods and medications are much more useful.
- You should regenerate your DIM1 (the End) if you've visited it before and want to enjoy the new content.

### Bugs Squashed
- The End Dragon is now summonable. Address [#429](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/429)
- Fixed a problem with GalactiCraft Biomes IDs. Fixes [#431](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/431)
