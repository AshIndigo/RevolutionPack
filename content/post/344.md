Hi all!

My apologies for the small update -- my availability has dropped dramatically and I only have time to push these couple updates.

### Pack Changes
- Added many more quests, thanks to Eb! For existing worlds, you'll need to do ```/bq_admin default load``` to access them.
- Mobs only grief if they have the right tool (e.g., break blocks if they have a pick). This should slow down the madness.

### Bugs Squashed
- Fixed a problem with mobs not spawning in the Nether.
- Edit mode is now off by default for the quests.
