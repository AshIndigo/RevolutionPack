Hello everyone!

Welcome to the next exciting release of REVOLUTION|2! Today's update mostly addresses the SMP crash issue with v13 of Reika's mods and Ender IO, while adding a few convenience of life additions, including Crafting Tweaks! Yay!

Volcanoes have also been re-enabled in world gen, now that RTG finally supports it. Also, Practical Logistics crashes have been addressed. It's a great mod to try! 

### Pack Changes
- Increased frequency of ReactorCraft ores in the Cave dimension.
- Hives (including the Ender Hive) can be created through Botania Mana Alchemy. You can scoop up hives by crafting a Scooperator MX200 (from Gendustry) and right-clicking a hive (not left-clicking).

### Bugs Squashed
- NASA workbench recipe adjusted to use vanilla and compatible crafting tables. Fixes [#422](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/422)
- Vibrant and Energetic alloys can once again be smelted correctly in the Arc Furnace. Fixes [#416](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/416)
- Portals to the Deep Dark and Last Millenium have been disabled; they were never intended to be used, but their existence caused confusion. Addresses [#419](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/419)
- Ender Hives can be transmuted through Botania; solves the problem with them not generating in The End. Fixes [#427](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/427)
