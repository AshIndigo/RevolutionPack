+++

Good day everyone, Haggle here!

We have a big update in store for you today, but no worries, it's BACKWARDS compatible! Yes, that's right, it will work just fine with version 2.5.0.0 maps! 

We've updated a number of mods, including finally moving AE2 to RV3. We've also fixed some of the most annoying bugs, including super speed zombies and uncraftable apiarist's chests. We've also buffed ore output! (yay!)

In addition, we've added Binnie's mods back into the game, so you have another alternative for ore generation. Expect Magic Bees in the near future too; unfortunately, they couldn't be added at the same time of this update due to Rockhounding's block updates. But it will feature in a future update. 

As usual, there may be some minor chunk-border issues with this update on newly generated chunks, but they should be very minor and actually look nice versus sheer walls. The new hives from Binnie's mods will of course not appear in existing chunks, so you'll need to do some exploring if you want to delve into bees. Server admins who don't want to generate new chunks can add a bee vendor to their spawn area.

### Pack Changes
- Slowed down super-speed zombies
- Doubled the amount of time for both player and chunks to reach maximum difficulty (now about 100 hours of game time)
- GUIs have been offset to allow room at the top left for the ChromatiCraft Lumen meter
- RF power is approximately 1/4 as useful as shaft power in AE2 systems (e.g., RotaryCraft shaft power is preferred source for AE2)
- Significantly improved the damage output of Open Modular Turrets. Because overkill is a thing.
- Immersive Engineering blast furnace now consume 6 hard ore per block instead of 8.

- Applied Energistics to RV3
