Hello everyone!

Welcome to another fantastic release of REVOLUTION|2! This week's update focuses mostly on integrating the latest and greatest v11 of Reika's mods, which includes MANY fixes to known bugs and issues. Hooray for bugfixes and a BIG thanks to Reika for all his hard work!

There's also been a huge pass on block physics. A lot more things won't fall anymore. Yay! We've also managed to make the Rod of the Plentiful Mantle show all the ore again. Finally, a reliable, non-cheat way to discover ores in your area (this also fixes things like /oredistribution).

We've also managed to squash some annoying problems with world gen, reducing memory usage a bit and improving generation performance. It's still not quite fast enough for most machines, so coming in the next update I will be including an optional pregenerated map for players with slow, small, or older computers. There's no in-game advantage to playing this map, other then it's pregenerated in a 1600 block radius (100 chunks), and it's been verified to have all important ores within a happy distance of spawn. Hopefully, this will allow more players to enjoy REVOLUTION|2, who wouldn't otherwise.

Technically, world gen has changed in this update, but there's no reason to go out and restart your maps. You won't get any annoying chunk borders with this patch, except in the Cave Dimension. The Cave Dimension's ore generation was rewritten using CoFH to keep it cleaner, faster, and most importantly--denser. :)  

Lastly, those of you with RotaryCraft Canola planted on AgriCraft crop sticks should remove them prior to the update.

### Changes
- Harder Ores are now visible throug the Rod of the Plentiful Mantle, /oredistribution, and various other means of locating ore. 
- Due to the AgriCraft and RotaryCraft updates, you should remove any canola seeds from crop sticks prior to updating. They are safe to replant after the update. 
- Wheat, bonemeal, and sugar must now all be milled in some fashion.
- Only vanilla and copper ore flowers generate naturally. Other ores' flowers still generate when bonemealing the ground. This only affects newly-generated chunks.  
- Replaced Chisel ore gen with Custom Ore Gen. 
- Killer bunnies
- Huge revamp of block physics for many mods. Less things should fall, in general; a few things, like chiseled dirt, are softer. Mods: catwalks, agricraft, chromaticraft, chisel, electricraft, ender io, enhanced inventories, decocraft, etc. Note, some authors implemented blocks in an unusual way, and there's nothing I can do about how physics alters those mods' fallen block properties. General rule of thumb: if it's expensive, don't drop it.

### HQM Notes
- You can now complete the 'Is Your Steel Dark' quest.
- The 'I'm All Charged Up' quest now detects more basic capacitors.
- The 'Only As Good As Your Tools' quest now requires a juicer instead of a second baking dish. It rewards something nice now, too.

### Known Issues
- Using up an Immersive Engineering hammer (and likely any tool that takes damage while crafting) while in a Ewy's Workshop table will cause a CTD.

### Bugs Squashed
- You can no longer break bedrock using Rockhounding machines. Fixes [#274](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/274)
- The Rod of the Plentiful Mantle now finds ores again. Fixes [#256](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/256)
- NEI grinder recipes should not crash. You may need to clear your NEI cache (delete /saves/NEI). Closes [#205](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/205)
- CC Runes no longer fall. Fixes [#275](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/275)
- Inventory Tweaks no longer causes problems for the Botania Mana Tablet (thanks to OmegaCenti!)
- JourneyMap no longer loses part of the map when you quit SMP.
