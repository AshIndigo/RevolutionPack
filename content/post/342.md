Hi all!

Small update here to fixup some bugs and issues discovered since the last update. No mod updates, just a bunch of config fixes and tweaks.

### Pack Changes
- Made souls more passive -- they're basically standing chests until attacked -- due to certain issues with them aggroing upon teleport
- Unofficially renaming the pack tagline to 'Fear the Rain'. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out why.
- Passive mobs hate you again and with even more disgust
- Made mobs more omnipotent. Not quite as omnipotent as Stephen Colbert, but more so than Robert Downy Jr, and more likely to destroy things than Cher.

### Bugs Squashed
- You can no longer make draconium ingots by smelting draconium dust. Addresses [#535](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/535)
- Techguns tab is back. Fixes [#537](https://github.com/Haggle1996/RevolutionPack/issues/537)
- Fixed a problem where the Advanced Rocketry Assembler and Structural blocks would fall apart due to gravity
