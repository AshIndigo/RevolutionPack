#Gameplay Changes - As of V1.0.9.9
This page outlines the various game play changes to individual mods. There are quite a few and most can be found in NEI. If you can't find or create your favorite recipe, this page is your last stop before logging an issue in the tracker.

##General changes
- Early game RF power is best provided through RotaryCraft's Rotational Dynamo
- You will need steel and RotaryCraft HSLA Steel in quantity.
- Ore generates in large but rare veins. It may take a bit longer to find iron, but its not uncommon to get 100 ore from one vein.
- Most machines require steel (plates, blocks, or ingots), RotaryCraft HSLA Steel, or both.
- A number of key mod components are made on the BuildCraft Assembly Table

##Applied Energistics
- Certus Quartz spawns in medium, rare veins above y-level 50
- Charged Certus Quartz can be found in small quantities inside Certus Quartz Veins
- RotaryCraft shaft power is approximately 4x more effective than RF for powering AE systems (yes, the Energy Acceptor accepts direct shaft power)

##Botania
- Mana Flux Field is disabled
- Passive flowers despawn after 24000 ticks
- Orechid cannot be crafted (and only produces Emeralds when cheated in)
- Orechid Ignem cannot be crafted

##BuildCraft
- Engine recipes now require thermal plates (made in a rolling mill)
- Quarry requires a bedrock pick and heat ray -- you'll need Tungsten before you can make it

- Refinery has been removed -- use Immersive Engineerings refinery or Buildcraft Additions

##BuildCraft Additions
- Raw plates are now created in the RailCraft Rolling Machine

- Default food values are halved instead of quartered.
- Food stack size is left at the default 64

- Constant hunger loss is disabled
- It takes much longer to starve to death
- You drain food faster when you are healing
- You respawn with 1/6th your full health
- Difficulty level scales hunger rates 50% more

##Iguana Tinker Tweaks
