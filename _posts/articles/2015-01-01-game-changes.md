#Gameplay Changes
This page outlines the various game play changes to individual mods. There are quite a few and most can be found in NEI. If you can't find or create your favorite recipe, this page is your last stop before logging an issue in the tracker.

##General changes
- Early game RF power is best provided through RotaryCraft's Rotational Dynamo
- You will need RailCraft steel and RotaryCraft HSLA Steel in quantity.
- Ore generates in large but rare veins. It may take a bit longer to find iron, but its not uncommon to get 100 ore from one vein.
- Most machines require RailCraft steel (plates, blocks, or ingots), RotaryCraft HSLA Steel, or both. Many machines require RotaryCraft parts to complete.
