#Gameplay Changes
This page outlines the various game play changes to individual mods. There are quite a few and most can be found in NEI. If you can't find or create your favorite recipe, this page is your last stop before logging an issue in the tracker.

##General changes
- Early game RF power is best provided through RotaryCraft's Rotational Dynamo
- You will need RailCraft steel and RotaryCraft HSLA Steel in quantity.
- Ore generates in large but rare veins. It may take a bit longer to find iron, but its not uncommon to get 100 ore from one vein.
- Most machines require RailCraft steel (plates, blocks, or ingots), RotaryCraft HSLA Steel, or both. Many machines require RotaryCraft parts to complete.

##Botania
- Mana Flux Field is disabled

##BuildCraft
- BuildCraft engines require RotaryCraft engines instead of pistons
- Quarry requires a bedrock breaker and heat ray -- you'll need Tungsten before you can make it

##Ender IO
- All machines require steel instead of Iron
- Dark Steel requires a steel plate instead of Iron

##ExtraUtilities
- Magnum torch disabled
- Angel Ring disabled
- Ender Lilies can only be found in the End
- Generators are much more expensive to build
- Ender Quarry requires a bedrock breaker and heat ray to construct.

##Forestry
- Disabled Ore Gen
- Forestry engines require steel plates

##Iguana Tinker Tweaks
- Vanilla tools can only be used for crafting
- Only Botania, RotaryCraft, Tinkers Construct, and ThaumCraft tools should function in the world -- let me know if you find something that works but shouldn't.

##JABBA
