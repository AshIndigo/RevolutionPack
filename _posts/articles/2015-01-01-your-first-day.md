##Alternate Terrain Generator (ATG) or Biomes O' Plenty (BoP)
When starting a new world, you have a couple of world type options -- either Biomes O' Plenty or ATG-Alternate Terrain Generator. I highly recommend changing your world type to ATG -- it generates more realistic rolling hills and surface forms, using the BoP biomes. However, on minimal-memory machines, ATG may cause some hiccups during world generation (there are some workarounds, however). Combined with the Big Trees and Streams mods, an ATG world will be unique and intriguing compared to most Minecraft worlds.

I also recommend enabling cheats -- just in case -- but if you're the kind that's susceptible to temptation, you can leave it off. We have another alternative in-game.

#The First Day...
Welcome to the Revolution! If you're playing in single-player, the first thing your going to want to do is gather enough wood and wool for a crafting table and bed. There's lots of creepy-crawly nasties at night that want to eat or kill you (and a few during the day - find someplace safe!). You'll also want to find a safe biome -- swamps and marshes spawn some of the most dangerous mobs.

While wandering around, keep your eye out for Plant Mega Pack berry bushes. While there's lots of food you can eat (and you'll need to eat a variety), berry bushes will give you one to three varieties of food to eat and are easy to propagate.

Your first task will be to build a basic Tinkers Construct tool set - pick, shovel, axe - from flint and wood. The pack features Iguana's Tweaks, so you'll need to level up your tools by building a smeltery.

Once you get tools that can mine iron, you can choose to continue with Tinker's Construct tools, or you can switch to Botania - either route will give you a good set of basic tools.

Most machines in this pack require Railcraft steel (ingot or plates), HSLA Steel, or both. Start with the RotaryCraft blast furnace once you find (and can mine) iron and redstone. Then work on building a RailCraft blast furnace...

Where you go from here is up to you: there's much to see and do in this pack and many places to explore...
