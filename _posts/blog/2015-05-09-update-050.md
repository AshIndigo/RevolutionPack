#The 'Can't we all just get along?' Update 0.5.0 Released!

Hi everyone! 

A new version of the Revolution Pack has been released to the ATLauncher! (Pack Code: RevolutionPack). Detailed changelogs can be found on the ATLauncher link above.

Version 0.5.0 brings many game balance and quality of life updates to the pack, as well as a slew of new mods. Most notably, Grimoire of Gaia mob spawn rates have been reduced significantly for hostile mobs that spawn in daylight. They aren't gone entirely...but new players will have a much easier time in the more difficult biomes. Ore gen has also been significantly changed in Atum and the Twilight Forest. I highly recommend you delete DIM7 and DIM17 for a fresh ore gen; however, ore regeneration is turned on so you should still see the changes.

Notable new mods:
## Quality of Life:
- Better Foliage, HoloInventory, TiC Tooltips, Steve's Addons, AOBD
## Server Play:
- Hats and HatStands, Tails
## Content:
- Ye Gamol Chattels

Next update will be focused on new content.
