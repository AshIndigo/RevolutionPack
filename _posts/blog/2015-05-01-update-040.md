#'It's Amazing what we can Accomplish Together' Update 0.4.1 Released!

Hi everyone! 

A new version of the Revolution Pack has been released to the ATLauncher! (Pack Code: RevolutionPack). Detailed changelogs can be found on the ATLauncher link above.

Version 0.4.1 includes the first two chapters of our long-anticipated Achievements update: In Chapter 1, as one of the survivors of the Revolution, you must scramble to find food, shelter, and basic tools before everything tries to eat you. And in Chapter 2, our intrepid survivors build a more permanent station for a base camp, leveraging their knowledge of technical and magical systems to produce renewable resources for future growth.

Version 0.4.1 also includes a number of general mod updates and fixes, as well as balancing changes to the game (making it a touch more difficult). Revolution is a stable, involving pack with much to see and do.

And coming in Chapter 3: Chaos and Mutations!
