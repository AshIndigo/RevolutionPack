#Revolution Pack Released on ATLauncher!

It's a very proud moment for me having the pack finally listed on the ATLauncher. After spending countless hours over the last several months pulling this pack together, it was a triumph to see the pack logo listed right there in the launcher. Thank you all for the words of encouragement.

Special thanks go out to Reika, as well as the other mod authors. Without you, this pack would never have seen the light of day. And a very big gracias to RazzleberryFox for the pack logo and my avatar. I love your work!

There's still a lot of work to do on the modpack. Currently, I'm working heavily on the HQM quests. The book in-game right now is sadly lacking in every dimension. For the most part, mod selection is stable, though I have a few changeups planned in the near future. Nothing world-breaking. Most importantly, I want your worlds to be stable. I also need to work on balancing the end-game -- bees and power are too easy once you get going.

And, as always, I appreciate any feedback you have. Please don't hesitate to drop me a line (at the bottom of the page) on twitter, IRC, or gmail. I want this pack to be as much my players as it is mine.
