#'No Rest for the Weary' Update 0.3.0 Released!

Hi everyone! 

A new version of the Revolution Pack has been released to the ATLauncher! (Pack Code: RevolutionPack). Detailed changelogs can be found on the ATLauncher link above.

Version 0.3.0 brings some a new gameplay mechanic: tiredness! Now, not only will you burn hunger with every action, you'll also get more tired, 'till you collapse to the ground and sleep wherever you happen to be. Caffeine will offset the affects of exhaustion...for a while. But also remember, if you're well-rested, you won't be able to sleep when it gets dark.

Also in 0.3.0, besides some general updates and bug fixes, is a heavily-nerfed Magical Crops 4.0! But in order to get the essence necessary to start growing your ores, you're going to have to visit The End! (dunh dunh duuuuunh!!!!). Think The End is a cakewalk? I've added Hardcore Ender Expansion to keep you company.
