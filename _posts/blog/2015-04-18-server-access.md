#Revolution Pack has a Server!

Hi everyone! 

Just a note to let everyone know that the Revolution Pack has a private white-listed server for testing the latest builds of the pack. If you're interested in access to the server and helping develop the pack, please drop me a message through the usual suspects at the bottom of the page: twitter, IRC, or gmail. Please include your IGN, your preferred method of contact, and your acknowledgement that you won't cause any grief for other players. (Mature or 18+ only).
