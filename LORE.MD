SITCON:
Your team has been in cryogenic suspension for nearly 500 years, after a nuclear holocaust destroyed nearly every living being on the surface. The earth has recovered and it's time for humanity to take back the surface of the planet. Your group must strike out from the remnants of the Cheyenne Mountain bunker and build a secure site before the last of the personnel and equipment can be brought to the surface.

SITREP Day 1:
Initial observations indicate a number of lifeforms have survived the holocaust. The increased radiation seems to have mutated a number of creatures. Jones was injured when a creature, which we've dubbed the mantikitten, attacked him while we were in the field. We've retreated back to the ruins for the night. 

SITREP Day 4:
We've secured a cave not far from here to act as a forward base. More has changed than we thought: we've run across a number of strange pylons that emit a narrow field of microwaves. Staying too close for too long leads to pain and injury.

SITREP Day 5:
Smith was sent back to the base after he injested some of the new flower breeds we've discovered. Hope he recovers quickly.

SITREP Day 7:
A scouting party came across a small 'node' of some sort. About the size of a baseball, it glows faintly and floats in the air. Oddly enough, not everyone can see them. None of our equipment seems to register their existence. We've requested more lab material for additional testing.

SITREP Day 9:
We've sighted a good spot for Bravo Site and will do a full evaluation once the rest of the scientific team arrives at the camp.

SITREP Day 10:
Smith returned to the group yesterday. Last night, while camped at the potential Bravo Site, Smith insisited he could conjure lightning out of thin air. Everyone laughed but then he gave us a demonstration. Something's happening to us. Arnolds thinks its the radiation from those pylons.

SITREP Day 14:
Science and engineering teams have confirmed Bravo Site is a go. Request for remaining team members in cryogenic suspension to be awakened has been submitted.

SITREP Day 15:
The entire forward team at Bravo Site was found dead this morning by our early patrol. Looks like they were attacked by the local critters. We buried all of the bodies except for Smith, whose body we couldn't find. We are increasing the size of our patrols and taking additional perimeter security measures.

Personal Log - Day 181,926:        It took a few moments for my head to adjust to what I read on the computer screen when it woke me up from cryo-sleep. Almost 500 years. That’s how long we’ve been in hibernation. My team – a group comprised mostly of scientists, engineers, and security personnel, along with our families – evacuated to this underground facility the moment the insurgency launched coordinated assaults on capitols around the world. The timing couldn’t have been better. We don’t know who fired the first nuclear weapon, but the world-wide military response was devastating. As revolutionaries stormed capitols and occupied military bases around the world, the missiles and bombs began to fall, plunging the world into a nuclear holocaust. Safe in our bunker, we had no choice but to put our ‘Eden’ plan into motion: placing us all into cryo-sleep while the rest of civilization above us died off in the atomic winter, so that we could rebuild the world in better days to come. With our facility’s geothermal power source finally waning after the millennia, the computer woke us. That was this morning. As the leader of the first-response team, we’ve been woken up ahead of the others to return to the surface and secure a base of operations...ahh, hell. Let's call it Day 1.

Personal Log-Day 1
DISASTER! As we egressed the complex, a large section of the underground tunnels collapsed behind us, leaving my team isolated from our equipment, supplies, and the rest of our personnel.

Personal Log-Day 9
We've put a proper sign in place, marking the name of our camp. Everyone cheered and applauded. It's been hard work, but we've managed to secure the site and get some rudimentary metalwork up and running. What I wouldn't give to have access to the arc furnace buried inside our bunker! Now our efforts are turning to sustainable farming. We've been foraging for food, but it's time to plant crops before the winter sets in.

Personal Log-Day 38
Farming is hard work! I have blisters on blisters on places that shouldn't even have blisters! We've planted enough food to feed the remaining personnel once we dig them out -- if we can dig them out before the power runs out, that is. I dread the thought, but we're working against the clock. There's no way we can clear the millions of tons of debris with our bare hands and simple tools. Fortunately, we have the know-how, we just need to build more advanced machinery.

Personal Log-Day 110
Success!! The last couple of days have been nothing short of miraculous, as we finally dug through the remaining few feet of debris and were able to awaken and reunite with the rest of our personnel and families. The celebration alone lasted nearly three days, but our jubilation is rapidly diminishing now that the reality has set in that we're no longer a camp of just 15 -- now nearly 200. Our efforts must now turn to building a sustainable town for our much larger population. The bunker is more or less a total loss. Excavations will continue, and I'm sure we'll be able to pull some odds and ends out of it, but it's rapidly filling with water and mud.

Personal Log-Day 204
Now that the winter has set in, we've got some time to study our environment in our new laboratory. We've come across a number of curious locations across the world, particularly these energy pylons that dot the landscape. Our current theory is that these mark ground zero for each nuclear detonation. No one recognizes the technology or materials, but they somehow contain the energy up to a point. We're going to start investigating this strange energy and others like it. 

Personal Log-Day 399
More than a year has come and gone. The longer we're here, the more we come to realize how fragile our world is. Many of us now believe that the only means of guaranteeing mankind's survival is to colonize the stars. It's time for the human race to return to space and fulfill our destiny!

Personal Log-Mars Day 1
We've landed successfully on Mars after a flawless journey from the Earth. Now to turn this planet into the paradise it was intended to be!
