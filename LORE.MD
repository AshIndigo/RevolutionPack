SITCON:
Your team has been in cryogenic suspension for nearly 500 years, after a nuclear holocaust destroyed nearly every living being on the surface. The earth has recovered and it's time for humanity to take back the surface of the planet. Your group must strike out from the remnants of the Cheyenne Mountain bunker and build a secure site before the last of the personnel and equipment can be brought to the surface.

SITREP Day 1:
Initial observations indicate a number of lifeforms have survived the holocaust. The increased radiation seems to have mutated a number of creatures. Jones was injured when a creature, which we've dubbed the mantikitten, attacked him while we were in the field. We've retreated back to the ruins for the night. 

SITREP Day 4:
We've secured a cave not far from here to act as a forward base. More has changed than we thought: we've run across a number of strange pylons that emit a narrow field of microwaves. Staying too close for too long leads to pain and injury.

SITREP Day 5:
Smith was sent back to the base after he injested some of the new flower breeds we've discovered. Hope he recovers quickly.

SITREP Day 7:
A scouting party came across a small 'node' of some sort. About the size of a baseball, it glows faintly and floats in the air. Oddly enough, not everyone can see them. None of our equipment seems to register their existence. We've requested more lab material for additional testing.

SITREP Day 9:
We've sighted a good spot for Bravo Site and will do a full evaluation once the rest of the scientific team arrives at the camp.

SITREP Day 10:
Smith returned to the group yesterday. Last night, while camped at the potential Bravo Site, Smith insisited he could conjure lightning out of thin air. Everyone laughed but then he gave us a demonstration. Something's happening to us. Arnolds thinks its the radiation from those pylons.

SITREP Day 14:
Science and engineering teams have confirmed Bravo Site is a go. Request for remaining team members in cryogenic suspension to be awakened has been submitted.

SITREP Day 15:
The entire forward team at Bravo Site was found dead this morning by our early patrol. Looks like they were attacked by the local critters. We buried all of the bodies except for Smith, whose body we couldn't find. We are increasing the size of our patrols and taking additional perimeter security measures.
