{"name":"Revolution Pack","tagline":"Revolution Pack for Minecraft 1.7.10","body":"# Revolution Pack\r\n\r\nThe Revolution Pack is Minecraft ModPack designed to showcase [Reika's fine mods](https://sites.google.com/site/reikasminecraft/home), particularly RotaryCraft and Chromaticraft, in a medium-core playing environment inspired (loosely) by hardcore GregTech packs. Some notable features are:\r\n- Gated mod progression through RotaryCraft -- convert those stacks of Iron ore into HSLA, 'cause you're gonna need it.\r\n- Overhauled ore generation to make mining more exploratory and less grindy. Not every chunk will have iron in it -- but once you find a vein, you'll have enough for your next round of machinery.\r\n- Automated ore generation in mid-game (Bees and TC)\r\n- Several sorting systems (logistics pipes, AE, Refined Relocation, etc.)\r\n- Lore and quests/achievements - the in-game quest book will guide you through the pack (optional)\r\n- Medium-core: challenging, but not grindy or excessively difficult.\r\n- Encourages movement through ancilliary mods\r\n\r\n## Roadmap:\r\n\r\nCompleted:\r\n- [x] Ore generation is complete\r\n- [x] Mod selection is stable\r\n\r\nIn progress:\r\n- [2%] Quest writing\r\n- [10%] Mod difficulty and gating\r\n\r\nTo Do:\r\n- [ ] Mod-pack branding\r\n- [ ] Website\r\n- [ ] Channel\r\n- [ ] Forum presence\r\n\r\nIn Consideration:\r\n- [ ] Hunger revamp\r\n- [ ] End-game alternatives\r\n- [ ] \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
