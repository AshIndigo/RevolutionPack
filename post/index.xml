      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s happening! Revolution|2 Alpha 1 has been pushed to the AT Launcher, and should be appearing soon in your pack list. Revolution|2 is the continuation of the original Revolution pack on the AT Launcher. Hundreds of hours of development and testing have gone into making Revolution|2 a significantly new and exciting game, distinctly different from the original Revolution, while retaining the best aspects of the original. I’d like to take a moment here to thank all those that made the original Revolution spectacular (particularly Ieldra, SentinalH, CyanideX, DorinnB, Solego, and all of the pack testers on the development server. I’d also like to extend a heap of gratitude to NachtRaben and DaMachinator, who contributed to the development of Revolution|2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revolution|2 is an extensive revamp of the original, featuring many new and updated mods, in addition to old familiars and favorites. Please check out the Gameplay Changes article (available from the menu) for details about the pack, and keep your eye here (or on the launcher screen within the pack) for breaking news and updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revolution|2 is currently in alpha release. This means that some of the content (most notably HQM quests and the custom bee progression) has not been included in the download. Also, we expect worlds created in the alpha to not be compatible with beta worlds, as we expect some incoming breaking changes to world generation; however, we expect Please report any issues with the pack on the issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
