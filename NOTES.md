## Pack changes


<Pterodactlol> I was thinking about the Techguns nuke launcher. Would it be reasonable to place ReC breeder reactors as a requirement?
<Pterodactlol> from what I see, the Techguns nuke requires a chem lab and reaction chamber to make
<Haggle1996> For progression? Seems reasonable.
<Haggle1996> I haven't done a progression pass on Techguns yet.
<Pterodactlol> well, its not a matter of progression
<Pterodactlol> I was just thinking: replace the TG yellowcake with ReC plutonium, then rename the TG enriched uranium to "weapons grade plutonium"
<Pterodactlol> I guess what I mean is, place the nuclear parts of techguns behind both techguns and ReC
<Haggle1996> Ah. Makes more sense now.
<Pterodactlol> as it is, it looks like 1 uranium ingot can be crafted into 2 tactical nuke
<Haggle1996> You said you wanted nukes
<Pterodactlol> that seems too easy to me, especially since the tec nukes deal 250 damage in an AoE
<Pterodactlol> oh yes, I love the idea of nuke
<Pterodactlol> but I want to *earn* them
