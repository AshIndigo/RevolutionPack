# REvolution Pack

The REvolution Pack is designed to showcase Reika's fine mods, particularly RotaryCraft and Chromaticraft, in a hardcore playing environment inspired (loosely) by hardcore GregTech packs like BeyondReality. Expected features will be:
- Gated mod progression through RotaryCraft
- Overhauled ore generation to make mining camps more relevant and expansion into other worlds (galacticraft, deep dark) more useful
- Several automated ore generation options in midgame (bees, TC, nerfed Magical Crops?)
- Several sorting systems
- Lore and quests/achievements
- Make it HARD, not grindy
- Encourage movement through ancilliary mods

## TODO:
- [ ] Everything :P

- [ ] Ore Generation
- [ ] Modpack Gating
- [ ] Branding
- [ ] HQM or HQM-like guide solution

## Mod ideas
- The Erebus (Twilight Forest replacement) http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/220698-the-erebus
- Electrical Age http://electrical-age.net/

## Random Ideas
- Hunger revamp using plant mega pack
- alternative mods to roguelike dungeons (not doomlike)
- Ruins or other structure spawning to give world flavor
