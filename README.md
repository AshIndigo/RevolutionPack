# Revolution Pack

The Revolution Pack is Minecraft ModPack designed to showcase [Reika's fine mods](https://sites.google.com/site/reikasminecraft/home), particularly RotaryCraft and Chromaticraft, in a medium-core playing environment inspired (loosely) by hardcore GregTech packs. Some notable features are:
- Gated mod progression through RotaryCraft -- convert those stacks of Iron ore into HSLA, 'cause you're gonna need it.
- Overhauled ore generation to make mining more exploratory and less grindy. Not every chunk will have iron in it -- but once you find a vein, you'll have enough for your next round of machinery.
- Automated ore generation in mid-game (Bees and TC)
- Several sorting systems (logistics pipes, AE, Refined Relocation, etc.)
- Lore and quests/achievements - the in-game quest book will guide you through the pack (optional)
- Medium-core: challenging, but not grindy or excessively difficult.
- Encourages movement through ancilliary mods
